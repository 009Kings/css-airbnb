#Airbnb Mockup

Lots of websites, including Facebook and Airbnb, use a grid layout to display common elements, such as information cards, photos, and other information. The best way to learn how to create these different layouts is to try them ourselves. So let's try recreating a portion of Airbnb's website.

##Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your computer
* Create an `index.html` file and a `style.css` file. You may want to put the CSS file in its own folder, in order to keep your file structure organized

##Requirements
* Look at the deliverable screenshot and see how well you can match it.
* Keep the following in mind when recreating the screenshot
  * Using the right font
  * Obtaining and using relevant images
  * Aligning the text in the center of each image
  * Aligning the images in the center of each page
  * Thinking of the layout in terms of rows and columns

##Bonus
Design agencies will usually have you own and create the whole page, not just a small portion of it. Try recreating the rest of the Airbnb home page!

##Deliverable

Here's a screenshot of the portion that should be replicated.
